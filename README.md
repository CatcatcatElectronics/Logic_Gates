# Logic_Gates
A game, a simulator, a gift - the development of logical thinking. The Logic Gate project is designed to develop logical thinking in children and can also be used as a kit - a board for learning C programming and working with microcontrollers from Microchip Corporation.

**_Printed circuit board design_**

## Task:

> Build a simple PCB tutorial project, control LEDs with built-in drivers, explore capacitive sensors for user interface, and learn how to work with a UART serial interface (for DIY projects).


## System Parameters:
> **MCU** - PIC18F27Q84-I/SS,
> **LED_CHIP** - SK6812MINI-EA,
> **USB-BRIDGE** - CH343P,
> **Connecting to a PC** - TYPE-C.
